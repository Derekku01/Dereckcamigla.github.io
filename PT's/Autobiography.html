        <p>Charles Babbage was born on Dec. 26, 1791 in England. He was a polymath and became a mathematician, mechanical engineer, inventor, and philosopher. 
        He contributed to many different scientific fields but his most famous work is designing a programmable computing device.</p>
        <p>Charles Babbage is considered the “father of the computer” and is given credit for devising the first ever mechanical computer. 
        His design served as the blue print for other, more complex machines.</p>
        <p>In 1991, a functioning Difference Engine No. 2 was built based on Babbage's original drawings at the Science Museum, 
        London.It consisted of 8,000 parts, weighed five tons, and measured 11 feet long. The engine was built under conditions 
        that were available during the 19th century. In 2000, the Science Museum also completed the printer Babbage had designed for the difference engine.</p>

        <p>The analytical engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, 
        making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete. In other words, 
        the structure of the analytical engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era. T
        he analytical engine is one of the most successful achievements of Charles Babbage.</p>
        <p>Babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding.
        It was not until 1941 that Konrad Zuse built the first general-purpose computer, Z3, more than a century after Babbage had proposed 
        the pioneering analytical engine in 1837</p>
